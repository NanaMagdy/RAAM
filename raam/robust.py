    """
    Computes transition matrices from samples that are suitable for use with an 
    aggregation and robust or fragile (optimistic) optimization. Aggregated
    decision states are treated individually (as long as they are assigned
    different indices) by constructing appropriate decision matrices. 
    Aggregated expectation states are treated as identical.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : raam.samples.Samples
    decagg : function (decstate -> (int,int)), optional.
        A function that assigns the number of the aggregate state and its index
        within the aggregation to each individual sample *decision* state.
        If omitted, the numbers are assigned automatically 
        based on the first and the second feature.
    expagg : function (expstate -> int), optional
        A function that assigns the number of the aggregate state to each individual
        sample *expectation* state. If omitted, the numbers are assigned automatically 
        based on the first feature value. If the state is not meant to be aggregated
        then the aggregation function may return a value that is outside of the
        range (e.g. -1). However, this is only valid if the expectation state is
        the target in decision samples and not a source in expectation samples.
    aggdecstates : int, optional
        Number of aggregated *decision* states. If omitted, the samples are
        traversed to determine the number of aggregations.
    aggexpstates : int, optional
        Number of aggregated *expectation* states. If omitted, the sample are
        traversed to determine the number of aggregations. 
    numoutcomes : list, optional
        Number of outcomes (or indices) for every aggregation states. If omitted,
        it is computed by traversing all samples.

    Returns
    -------
    dectoexp : numpy.ndarray
        List of transitions for all aggregate states. For each aggregate state
        the list contains a *masked* matrix (np.ndarray) with dimensions 
        #actions x #outcomes. The entries with no samples are considered to be masked.
        Each outcome corresponds to a decision state (from decision samples)
        with a unique index. Each entry is an index of the corresponding
        expectation state (row number in exptodec).
    exptodec : scipy.sparse.dok_matrix
        Sparse transition matrix from expectation states to decision states.
    actions : list
        List of actions available in the problem. Actions are sorted alphabetically.
    initial : numpy.ndarray
        Initial distribution
    rewards : numpy.ndarray
        Average reward for each expectation state
        
    Notes
    -----
    If there are no transitions out of an aggregated *decision state* then 
    it is considered to be a terminal state.
    
    If there is no transition out of an expectation state, the transition to 
    this expectation state is ignored.
    
    The values are returned in a dictionary.

    exptodec : scipy.sparse.matrix
        Sparse transition matrix from expectation states to decision states
    rewards : numpy.ndarray
        Average reward for each expectation state    
    discount : float, array(__getitem__)
        The discount factor in [0,1]. Guaranteed to work when discount < 1, but 
        may also work when discount = 1
    type : {``'robust'``,``'optimistic'``}, optional
        - If ``robust``, the method computes the robust result 
            (with the worst case over outcomes).
        - If ``optimistic``, the method computes the optimistic result
            (with the best case over outcomes).
    uncertainty : {``'simplex'``,``'l1'``}
        The type of uncertainty sets
    distributions : numpy.ndarray (#states) , optional
        Base distributions for each state (action independent). Each entry is 
        a distribution over robust actions.
    bounds : numpy.ndarray (#states)
        Bounds on the deviation from the underlying probability distribution
            
    Returns
    -------
    value : numpy.ndarray (#decstates)
        The computed value function
    policy_vec : numpy.ndarray (#decstates x #actions)
        Probability of actions for each decision state
    bounds : float
        The residual after the computation * 2 / (1-discount). 
        This is the bound on the suboptimality of the solution.
