Simulator tools (:mod:`raam.simulator`)
===========================================

This module also provides a simple framework for implementing a simulator that 
can be used to generate samples. In particular, a simulator must implement an 
interface :class:`raam.simulator.Simulator`. A template for the simulator is::
    class SimulatorTemplate(Simulator):  
        @property
        def discount(self):
            pass
        def transition_dec(self,decstate,action):
            pass
        def transition_exp(self,expstate):
            pass
        def end_condition(self,decstate):
            pass
        def initstates(self):
            pass
        def actions(self,decstate):
            pass
            
:class:`raam.simulator.Simulator` is generally a state-less simulator. It does not
need to track the state of the simulation.    
            
An alternative is to implement the simple simulator interface 
:class:`raam.simulator.StatefulSimulator`::
    class StatefulSimulatorTemplate(SimpleSimulator):  
        @property
        def discount(self):
            pass
        def transition_dec(self,action):
            pass
        def transition_exp(self):
            pass
        def end_condition(self,decstate):
            pass
        def reinitstate(self,parameters):
            pass
        def actions(self):
            pass
        
:class:`raam.simulator.SimpleSimulator` is generally a stateful simulator. It 
needs to track the current state of the simulation.

class Simulator(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    Represents a simulator class that can be used to generate samples.
    The class must be inherited from to define the actual simulator.

    The simulation is based on two types of states: 
        1. Decision states - states in which decisions are taken and the  deterministic 
            transition is to expectation states
        2. Expectation states - states from which the transition is stochastic 
            into decision states. The reward is also determined in this transition.

    See also :class:`StatefulSimulator` for a simulator framework that does not support
    sampling arbitrary states.

    The representation of the decision and expectation states may be arbitrary objects.
